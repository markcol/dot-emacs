# Emacs Configuration

My Emacs init.el and other Emacs customizations.

Features:

* Makes extensive use of [straight.el](https://github.com/raxod502/straight.el) and [use-package](https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package).

Misc:

* Fonts used in the config are stored in misc/fonts. Install them based on OS requirements.
